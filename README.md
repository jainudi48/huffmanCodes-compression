# HuffmanCodes-compression
This project is to compress and expand most of the file formats. I have not used any existing APIs for doing the same but have implemented the huffman coding algorithm to make it work.

# Steps to run the project:-
1. Open command prompt in the project directory.
2. Type "javac henc" for compilation of "henc" file.
3. After successful compilation, Type "java hencÂ <filename>" for compression of the given file.
4. Similar steps for decompression, first compline the "hdec" file then run it as "java hdec <filename>
